# Padang Cuisine Image Classification System

This project is an intelligent web-based system designed to classify traditional Padang cuisine using image recognition powered by deep learning (CNN - MobileNetV2). Users can upload an image of a dish and the system will return its predicted name along with a detailed description, historical background, ingredients, and a trusted source reference.

## üîç Features

- **9-Class Image Classification**: Recognizes 9 Padang cuisine categories:
  - Ayam Goreng, Ayam Pop, Rendang, Dendeng Batokok, Gulai Ikan, Gulai Tambusu, Gulai Tunjang, Telur Balado, Telur Dadar.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Upload images directly and receive classification results with cultural context.
- **Deep Learning Powered**: Uses MobileNetV2, pretrained and fine-tuned for efficient inference.
- **Deployed with Google Cloud Run**: Fully containerized backend and frontend services.

## üåê Architecture

The system is divided into two services:
1. **Backend (API)**: Receives images via POST, performs classification, returns a JSON response.
2. **Frontend (Web App)**: Allows users to upload images via a form, forwards to backend, and renders the result page.

üì§ **Workflow**:
- Upload ‚Üí Cloud Run (Frontend) ‚Üí Forward Image to Cloud Run (Backend) ‚Üí Prediction ‚Üí Return JSON ‚Üí Render Result
